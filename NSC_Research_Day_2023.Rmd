### WHAT
Are you interested in using programming skills to speed up your analysis? Do you have 16S rRNA data that you don't understand? The morning workshop will introduce you to the R programming language and how you can start implementing RStudio in your data analysis workflows. After a lunch sponsored by INBRE, we will go over how to analyze 16S rRNA microbiome data sets. **No prior coding experience is required and you may choose to only attend one of the workshops** 


### WHERE
This is an in-person workshop and will be held on the Nevada State College’s (NSC) campus. 


### WHO
The workshop’s intended audience are undergraduate students, but everyone interested in R and/or microbiome research is welcome to participate.
