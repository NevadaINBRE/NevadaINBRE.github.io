<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Interested in getting started with R programming, but don't know anything about programming or data analysis ... then come join us for our two-day bootcamp. </span><br>

This training will be focused around **hands-on learning activities** and you are welcome to submit your own data prior to the workshop - if you are lucky it will be chosen as an example data set. 

You will be introduced to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a> and to a popular editor <a href="https://posit.co/downloads/">Posit, formerly known as RStudio</a> while learning a little about Data Science. Example data sets will be used to practice data manipulation, organization, and graphical exploration. You are also encouraged to bring your own data and data challenges. In addition, major concepts of scientific research such as reproducibility will be addressed. Participants will gain the skills necessary to manage and organize data, run basic analyses, and generate beautiful, high-quality figures in R.

## Bootcamp Overview

R is a complete, flexible, and open source system for statistical analysis and graphics, and has become a tool of choice for many life scientists. 

### Day 1: R Crash Course with Introduction to Data Analytics

<img src="media/img/data_point.png" style="width: 230px; float: right; margin: 5px 10px 10px 20px;"/>Day 1 will be an introduction to programming with R and teach you how to use Rstudio. R basics will be covered, such as using the command line as a calculator, storing values in a variable, **basic data structures (vector, matrix, list, data frame, etc.)**, and data types. We will show how to **read-in basic data sets** and access rows/columns, and summarize data with statistics and plots. Then we will move on to **scripting in R, including control flow (choices and loops), writing functions, and installing/loading libraries** (and the differences between CRAN, GitHub, and Bioconductor packages).  

### Day 2: Tidy R, Figures, and Reproducibility 

We will discuss commonly seen coding problems and introduce what it means to **conduct reproducible data science**. During the second day, we will go through an example of **setting up a new project folder, loading "messy" data, organizing scripts, creating high quality plots, and creating output files**. In reference to the messy data, we will go over what "tidy" data is, and how to use `tidyverse` libraries. Then will go over some **principles of the visual display of quantitative data**, and go more into plotting in R with `base` and `ggplot2`.

## Things to Know

### Audience and Prerequisites


**No prior knowledge about data analytics or coding experience are necessary!**

 This bootcamp is addressed to beginners wanting to become familiar with the R syntax, environment, and the most common commands to start using R to explore, interpret, and present their data.

This **is NOT a training on statistics** but rather a training on how to use R to perform different tasks.

You will need your own laptop and must install <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R  language</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/downloads/">Posit (aka RStudio)</a> prior to the training, follow the instructions on their websites. We recommend to first download R and then Posit. 

You are encouraged to go through some of the R documentation: https://www.r-project.org/.
