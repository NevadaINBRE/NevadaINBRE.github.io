<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Interested in learning about Research Computing? </span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ever wondered how advanced high performance computing can transform your academic and research pursuits?</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Want to learn how to take advantage of local resources?</span><br>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">... then sign up for our **upcoming training event in November. ** </span></div><br>

Discover the power of Pronghorn, the cutting-edge HPC system on UNR's campus that could supercharge your research experience. Join us to embark on your journey from novice to HPC user in no time!

By the end of the workshop, you'll master the installations of programs using Conda, conquer the HPC scheduler (SLURM) like a pro, write simple bash scripts and converting them to SBTACH to allow for parallel processing.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to level up your HPC skills. 

## Workshop Overview

### Day 1: Introduction & Setup

In the first session we will make sure everyone is set up and can log into Pronghorn; we will discuss the local resources and the group's interst in Research Computing. 

**No prior programming or HPC experience is required.**
