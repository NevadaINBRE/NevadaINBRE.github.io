<!-- ## Research Day Overview -->

<!-- ### Introductory to R Programming -->

<!-- <img src="media/img/icon_coding.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"> In this training you will be introduced to the R programming language and Posit, formerly known as RStudio to analyze your data. We will teach you how to read and write data, manipulate it, and create publication-ready graphs. -->

<!-- **No prior programming experience is required.** <br> -->

<!-- ### Nevada INBRE Lunch -->

<!-- <img src="media/img/icon_lunch.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"> Come join us for an informal lunch to learn more about Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Microbiome Research, the INBRE program and how you can take advantage, or if you just want to chat about the world.  -->
