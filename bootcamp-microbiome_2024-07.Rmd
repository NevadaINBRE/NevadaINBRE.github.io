<!-- <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Interested in learning about Research Computing? </span><br> -->
<!-- <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ever wondered how advanced high performance computing can transform your academic and research pursuits?</span><br> -->
<!-- <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Want to learn how to take advantage of local resources?</span><br> -->

<!-- <div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">... then sign up for our **upcoming training event in November. ** </span></div><br> -->

<!-- Discover the power of Pronghorn, the cutting-edge HPC system on UNR's campus that could supercharge your research experience. Join us to embark on your journey from novice to HPC user in no time! -->

<!-- By the end of the workshop, you’ll master the installations of programs using Conda, conquer the HPC scheduler (SLURM) like a pro, write simple bash scripts and converting them to SBATCH submission scripts or SBATCH array scripts to allow for parallel processing. -->

<!-- Don't miss out on this opportunity to level up your HPC skills.  -->

<!-- ## Workshop Overview -->

<!-- ### Introduction & Setup -->

<!-- During the initial session, we will ensure everyone is configured and can successfully access Pronghorn. We'll also delve into the discussion of local computing resources and the group's interest in Research Computing.  -->

<!-- ### Mastering Command-Line Basics & UNIX Fundamentals -->

<!-- Moving on to the second session, our focus will shift towards mastering the UNIX file structure. We'll cover all the fundamental commands required to efficiently navigate, interact with, and manipulate files. -->

<!-- ### Creating Analysis Scripts & Navigating the SLURM Job Scheduler -->

<!-- In the concluding session, our attention will be on interacting with the SLURM job scheduler. The agenda includes hands-on activities starting by testing an analysis on a compute node, followed by scripting for automated analysis execution, and conversion of the script into an SBATCH script for running the analysis on Pronghorn. Additionally, we will cover the process of transferring files to and from Pronghorn. -->

<!-- ## Things to Know -->

<!-- ### Where -->
<!-- This is an in-person event and will be held on UNR's main campus; room information will be shared with accepted applications.  -->
<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ### Who -->
<!-- The workshop’s intended audience are graduate students, but everyone interested in utilizing HPC is welcome to participate - but registration is required, keep on reading.**No prior programming or HPC experience is required.** -->
