### WHAT
Are you interested in life science, data analytics and/or computing? Then this workshop is for you! This workshop will introduce you to the growing field of Bioinformatics and its applications. We will discuss bioinformatics approaches to analyze Bacteriophage samples and you will get the chance to run your own analysis.


### WHERE
This is an in-person workshop and will be held on the College of Southern Nevada’s (CSN) campus. <img src="media/img/Bacteria_Graphic_Blue.png" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">


### WHO
The workshop’s intended audience are undergraduate students, but everyone interested in Bioinformatics and Bacteriophage research is welcome to participate.

<!-- To tackle these types of problems, we can use supervised learning - the branch of Artificial Intelligence that uses labeled data to train algorithms for a particular task! -->

<!-- <a href="https://med.unr.edu/inbre">Nevada INBRE</a> and the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/bioinformatics">Nevada Bioinformatics Center</a> are pleased to announce the upcoming Python for Supervised Machine Learning Bootcamp. Through hands-on learning activities, we will cover  -->

<!--  - Module 1: Basics of Python for Data Science  -->
<!--  - Module 2: Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Classification and Regression  -->

<!-- You will come out of the bootcamp understanding how to wrangle data, build and train both simple and sophisticated models, and evaluate your models in the context of different use cases.  -->

<!-- ## Bootcamp Overview -->

<!-- ### Module I: Python Crash Course -->
<!-- <img src="media/img/Python-Symbol_logo.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and open source programming language. It is emerging as one of the most popular programming languages, both for scientific computing and general use. In the python crash course, we will cover an overview of python and programming fundamentals, and then describe how to use python for data processing, analysis, and visualization. At the end of this module, you will be able to: -->

<!-- - Write and debug basic python code -->
<!-- - Use functions, loops, conditional statements, and more advanced data structures to build higher level programs -->
<!-- - Analyze a dataset using python libraries built for data science -->
<!-- - Process your data for downstream applications, such as machine learning -->

<!-- ### Module II: Fundamentals of Supervised Machine Learning -->
<!-- <img src="media/img/ML_comic4.png" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">Supervised machine learning - the genre of machine learning that learns from past measurements or signals to make predictions on new data - has applications in nearly every field, from biology to art, astronomy to history. In this second part of the course, we will cover the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, working through the intuition behind supervised machine learning models and doing hands-on model development. At the end of this module you, you will be able to: -->

<!-- - Describe the intuition and concepts behind supervised machine learning, from both a high-level overview, and from a technical perspective -->
<!-- - Build, train, and test classification and regression models using python’s machine learning libraries -->
<!-- - Diagnose, tune, and refine your models in order to improve performance -->
<!-- - Identify the use cases and limitations of various machine learning models and datasets -->

<!-- ## Things to Know -->

<!-- ### Audience and Prerequisites -->

<!-- **Everyone** is welcome to apply. No prior knowledge of coding or machine learning are necessary! This bootcamp is intended for novice scientists wanting to become familiar with Python and ML concepts enabling them to applied these methods to their own research endeavors.  -->

<!-- For researchers looking for more advance help in Machine Learning, please send a request to <nbc_training@unr.edu>. -->


<!-- ### Application and Registration Fee -->

<!-- Spots are limited. Application for participation will be due **January 6th, 2023**, apply asap to reserve your spot. Late application may be considered if open seats remain.  -->
