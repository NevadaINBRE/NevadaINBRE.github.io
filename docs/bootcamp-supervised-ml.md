# Supervised Machine Learning Bootcamp

## Module I: Python Crash Course
Python is emerging as one of the most popular programming languages, both for scientific computing and general use. In the python crash course, we will cover an overview of python and programming fundamentals, and then describe how to use python for data processing, analysis, and visualization. At the end of this module, you will be able to:
* Write and debug basic python code
* Use functions, loops, conditional statements, and more advanced data structures to build higher level programs
* Analyze a dataset using python libraries built for data science
* Process your data for downstream applications, such as machine learning

## Module II: Fundamentals of Supervised Machine Learning
* Supervised machine learning - the genre of machine learning that learns from past measurements or signals to make predictions on new data - has applications in nearly every field, from biology to art, astronomy to history. In this second part of the course, we will cover the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, working through the intuition behind supervised machine learning models and doing hands-on model development. At the end of this module you, you will be able to:
* Describe the intuition and concepts behind supervised machine learning, from both a high-level overview, and from a technical perspective
* Build, train, and test classification and regression models using pythonâ€™s machine learning libraries
* Diagnose, tune, and refine your models in order to improve performance
* Identify the use cases and limitations of various machine learning models and datasets


## Module III: Introduction to Deep Learning 
Many believe that the most exciting branch of machine learning today is deep learning, a type of supervised machine learning that uses a neural network to make predictions on large, highly featured datasets (and is particularly powerful for images). In this module, we will extend what we have learned about supervised machine learning in order to develop and analyze deep learning models. Again, we will work through both the concepts central to deep learning, and perform hands-on model building, At the end, you will be able to:
* Describe the intuition, use cases, and limitations of fully-connected neural networks, a convolution kernel, and convolution neural networks
* Manipulate and preprocess image data to be used in deep learning models
* Use Keras/TensorFlow to construct your own neural networks and apply popular model architectures to classification tasks
* Refine and evaluate your deep learning models
