##  Overview

### <img src="media/img/icon_NSU_github.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">Introduction to Version Control and GitHub

 **Prerequisites:** None <br>
<br>

Whether you're new to version control or looking to improve your project management skills, this interactive workshop will guide you through the fundamentals of GitHub. Learn how to leverage this powerful tool for both collaboration and personal use, setting you up for success in managing and tracking code and data.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Set up and navigate GitHub
- Create and manage repositories for academic projects
- Collaborate on shared repositories

By the end of this session, you will have the skills to confidently use GitHub for version control and collaborative projects. 

<br>

### <img src="media/img/icon_NSU_R.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">Kickstart Your Journey with R

 **Prerequisites:** R and RStudio installed on your computer <br>
 <br>

This general hands-on workshop is ideal for researchers or students with no prior coding experience but an interest in data analysis looking to get started with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/downloads/">Posit, formerly known as RStudio</a> Designed for those with little to no coding experience, you’ll gain the foundation skills needed to import, investigate, and visualize data in R. 

Topics covered will include:

- **Setting up R and RStudio:** Navigating the interface and installing libraries/packages
- **Data handling:** Importing, exploring, and exporting datasets
- **Descriptive statistics:** Generating summary statistics to understand your data
- **Visualization:** Creating beginner-friendly plots to represent your data

**Bonus:** Do you have your own dataset and a question/task in mind? – Send your dataset and question to nbc_training@unr.edu by March 18th and we’ll do our best to integrate it into the training session. 

By the end of this session, you will be able to confidently use R for basic data analysis and visualization.

<br>

### <img src="media/img/icon_NSU_lunch.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">Lunch

Join us for an informal lunch where you can meet bioinformaticians and data scientists, learn about NSU’s INBRE programs, and explore research opportunities. It’s a great chance to connect, network, and chat about exciting opportunities in a relaxed setting. 

<br>

### <img src="media/img/icon_NSU_microbiome.png" style="width: 80px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;">Visualization of 16S Microbial Data with R

**Prerequisites:** Basic experience with R. (If you’re new to R, please attend the Kickstart Your Journey with R workshop in the morning.)

In this specialized workshop, you will learn how to analyze and visualize 16S rRNA microbial data using R. With a focus on microbial research, you’ll gain hands-on experience working with real data from NSU researchers. This session is designed to help you understand how to manage and visualize microbial community data effectively.

We will talk about how the raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) are handled to generate an Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) table. ASVs is a high-resolution method for microbial community analysis as an alternative to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs).

During the hands-on session, you'll focus on three key areas: 

- **Quality Control Measures:** Learn to evaluate the quality of microbial data using tools like rarefaction curves and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots
- **Taxonomic Diversity Analysis:** Explore the diversity of microbial taxa by examining their classifications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) across different samples and conditions. Techniques include alpha-diversity analysis and creating visualizations like stacked bar plots
- **Statistical Testing:** Conduct statistical analyses to identify microbial taxa that significantly differ between conditions

By the end of this workshop, you’ll be equipped to visualize, analyze, and present microbial data in a meaningful way, but you can also take these transferable skills and apply them to other projects.
