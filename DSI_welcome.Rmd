## **Exciting Announcement: Launch of New Data Science Initiative at the University of Nevada, Reno**

We are thrilled to announce the inception of a Data Science Initiative on our campus, led by a Nevada INBRE supplemental award and supported by Research & Innovation. This initiative aims to transform the landscape of data science at our institution, contribute to cutting-edge research and innovation, open new academic paths, and break silos across colleges, schools, and departments.

## Participate in Our Campus-wide Data Science Survey!

To shape this initiative effectively, we invite all members of our campus community to participate in a 10-15 min survey. Your insights and feedback are invaluable. By sharing your thoughts, you will play a vital role in shaping the future of our program. [Click here to access the survey](https://unr.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2cux0Tr4nJO9iS2). Submit your responses by Nov. 27, 2023 for a chance to be one of the lucky 50 participants who will win a $10 Starbucks gift card!

## Data Science Conference: March 7 & 8, 2024
 
Mark your calendars! We are excited to host a Data Science Conference on March 7 and 8, 2024. This event will bring together leading experts, researchers, and students. Our conference will feature keynote speakers, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities that you don't want to miss.
